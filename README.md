# Intelligent Discussion Board

A Natural Language Processing Model assisted Discussion Board.

## Description

This is an Inteligent Discussion Board that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project utilizes a Django framework for the front-end/website, and Python dependencies such as Huggingface's KeyBERT to aid in processing course documents and threads for keywords. Those keywords are then used by the Intelligent Bot to automatically respond to threads created by students. This project was created for the University of Texas at Dallas Senior Design Course (CS 4396).
